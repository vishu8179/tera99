How to find recent file in a directory?
Ans:mtimes
Ex:
find . -mtime 0   # find files modified between now and 1 day ago
                  # (i.e., within the past 24 hours)
find . -mtime -1  # find files modified less than 1 day ago
                  # (i.e., within the past 24 hours, as before)
find . -mtime 1   # find files modified between 24 and 48 hours ago
find . -mtime +1  # find files modified more than 48 hours ago

find . -mmin +5 -mmin -10 # find files modified between
                          # 6 and 9 minutes ago

Find nth max sal?
SELECT empno, salary
FROM
(SELECT empno, salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC)
WHERE rownum <=5;

or

select level,max(sal) from emp where level=&n connect by prior sal > sal group by level.


Removing Duplicates:

delete from emp where rowid not in(select min(rowid) from emp group by empno)

Datastage:
==========
Preserve partitioning flag has 3 possible settings

Set : downstream stages are to attempt to retain partitioning and sort order
Clear : downstream stages need not retain partitioning and sort order
Propagate : tries to pass the flag setting from input to output links

Conformed Dimension?
Junk Dimension?
Ans:A junk dimension is grouping of low cardinality flags and indicators. This junk dimension helps in avoiding cluttered design of data warehouse. 
Provides an easy way to access the dimensions from a single point of entry and improves the performance of sql queries
Ex: Table: Gender
Id Gender_status
----------------
1  Male
2  Female

Table: Marital Status
Id Marital_Status
----------------
1  Single
2  Married

Here both the dimensions have low cardinality flags. 
This will cause maintenance of two tables and decrease performance of sql queries.

We can combine these two dimensions into a single table by cross joining and can maintain a single dimension table.
The result of cross join is shown below:
id gender mrg_status
--------------------
1  Male      Single
2  Male      Married
3  Female   Single
4  Female   Married

typeSTEP_ID STEP_ID stringSource SRC stringDSN DSN stringUsername unm stringPassword pwd stringafter editing the above steps then

Diff. b/w Primary key & Surrogate Key?
Fact less fact table?
OLTP vs OLAP?
What is OSH Code?
Diff b/w 8.7 & 8.5?
Perfomence
8.5 :No toggle break point
8.7: Yes,The running job can be continued or aborted by using multiple breakpoints with 
conditional logic per link and node. (row data or job parameter values can be examined by breakpoint conditional logic)

What is Hash file?
Ans:Hash file stores the data based on hash algorithm and on a key value. 
A sequential file is just a file with no key column. Hash file used as a reference for look up. Sequential file cannot 

Lookup Performance issue reason?
lkp has it own cache memory. so it will fetch all dat and store it in a cache memory and performs join.
but when the data is high,the cache memory overflows so in order to accommodate all the data it will create additional disk files. 
so while doing lkp it has to open each and every additional disk files created for evry i/p record.so perfomance degrades
